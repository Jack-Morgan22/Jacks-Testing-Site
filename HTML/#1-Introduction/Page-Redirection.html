Page Redirection
You can use the same <meta> tag to redirect your page to any other webpage, which can be more useful than constantly refreshing the same page. Following is an example of redirecting the current page to another page after 5 seconds.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Meta Tags Example</title>
      <meta name = "keywords" content = "HTML, Meta Tags, Metadata" />
      <meta name = "description" content = "Learning about Meta Tags." />
      <meta name = "revised" content = " 3/7/2022" />
      <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "5; url=http://www.wlv.ac.uk" />
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Hello HCI!</p>
