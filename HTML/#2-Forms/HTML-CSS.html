Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced. W3C has actively promoted the use of style sheets on the Web since the consortium was founded in 1994.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags. Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element. Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:). Each property declaration is separated by a semi-colon (;).
First let's consider an example of HTML document which makes use of <font> tag and associated attributes to specify text colour and font size
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML CSS</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p><font color = "green" size = "5">Hello, World!</font></p>
   </body>
</html>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>HTML CSS</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p style = "color:green; font-size:24px;" >Hello, World!</p>
   </body>
</html>

You can use CSS in three ways in your HTML document −
•	External Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML document using HTML <link> tag.
•	Internal Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules in header section of the HTML document using <style> tag.
•	Inline Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules directly along-with the HTML elements using style attribute.
